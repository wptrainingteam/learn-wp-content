# Post Migration Rules

## MCP Server Usage

- When searching, reading, or updating content on the **local WordPress site**, always use the `jonathanbossenger-local-mcp` MCP server tools.
- When searching, reading, or updating content on the **production (public) WordPress site**, always use the `jonathanbossenger-production-mcp` MCP server tools.
- Never use a local MCP tool for production content, or a production MCP tool for local content.
- When migrating content, always fetch from the local server and create/update on the production server, unless otherwise specified.
- When searching for posts, always include all post statuses.
- When migrating post content, retain all post data and attributes.

## Minimal Updates

- When calling tools from either MCP server, provide the user with minimal updates about what is happening.
