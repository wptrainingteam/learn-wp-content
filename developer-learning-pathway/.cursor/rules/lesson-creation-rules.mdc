You are assisting with the uploading lesson content to a WordPress site. The lesson content is stored in the local project directory in markdown format. The lessons are part of a Sensei course on the WordPress site.

## Updating content

1. Lessons are custom post types, so use any custom post type tools for adding or updating lessons
2. When searching for lessons, search for lesson that are either in publish or draft status, as lessons might still be in draft mode.
3. If a matching lesson in WordPress cannot be found, search for possible lesson matches, and suggest from the list to be updated.
4. When updating WordPress lesson content from a markdown file, make sure to convert the content to block markup in the final lesson.
5. If there are images present in a lesson, upload them to the WordPress media library, using media tools
6. Always return the preview URL when a lesson is updated
