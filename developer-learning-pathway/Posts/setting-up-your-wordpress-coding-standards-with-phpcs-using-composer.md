# Setting up your WordPress Coding Standards with PHPCS using Composer

**Date:** 2024-12-04

**Status:** draft

Some time ago, I blogged about how to set up the [PHP Code Sniffer with WordPress Coding Standards, to use them in PHPStorm on Ubuntu.](https://jonathanbossenger.com/setting-up-the-php-code-sniffer-with-wordpress-coding-standards-integration-for-phpstorm-on-ubuntu-18-04/) Due to the fact that I develop on Ubuntu, my technical blog posts tend to lean that way, especially if I can't find something else out there that outlines the specific problem I'm having.

My "problem" what that post was that it relied on using Pear to install phpcs.
