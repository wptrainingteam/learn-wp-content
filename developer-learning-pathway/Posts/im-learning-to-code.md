# I'm learning to code!

Starting this Friday the 31st of January, 2025, I'm going to be learning to code.

The "catch" is that I'll be using AI coding tools exclusively, not writing a single line of actual code myself.

I want to see how good these tools are, how far I can push them, and what the quality of the code is that they generate.

Hopefully we'll all learn how to use them to improve our efficiency, rather than polluting the world with just more crappy code.

So join me every Friday at 12:00 UTC on Twitch:

Alternatively, catch the recording on my YouTube channel every Monday at 12:00 UTC:
